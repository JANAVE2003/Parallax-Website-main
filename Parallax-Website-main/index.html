            <h3>Why should I use parallax graphics?</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>There are two main reasons why designers should try parallax graphics:</p>
                <li>
                    <h4>It helps tell a story</h4>
                    <p>
                        Parallax graphics are ideal for storytelling. Good design is all about communication—and when we
                        design websites, we want to communicate with our visitors and tell a compelling story about our
                        product, service, or brand. Parallax scrolling allows us to immerse our website visitors in
                        unique online experiences. It's even possible to create a one-page website where visitors can
                        read an entire story about your product or brand without navigating to multiple pages.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>It helps to improve user engagement</h4>
                    <p>
                        Parallax graphics can be used to improve user engagement. Reducing your website’s bounce rate is
                        one of the goals to be conscientious of in web design. Bounce rate measures the percentage of
                        site visitors who either hit the “back” button or close the tab after checking just one page of
                        your
                        website. High bounce rates hurt your search ranking, so any actions you can take to bring that
                        rate down are worthwhile. A well-crafted parallax page gives the user the type of dynamic
                        experience that tends to keep them on the page longer.
                    </p>

            <h3>If you want to add a parallax scrolling effect to your website, you should consider the following tips.
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li aria-level="1">
                    <h4>Use it selectively</h4>
                    <p>
                        Parallax scrolling is much more powerful when you use it on one particular element as opposed
                        to all pages and all the time. Use it in headers and titles, or maybe on your homepage only.
                        You want parallax scrolling to strengthen your website's design, not distract users.

                    <h4>Image compression</h4>
                    <p>
                        Parallax scrolling uses a variety of media files and CSS shapes to create a sense of depth.
                        You don't want to compromise your web performance and user experience ith large image files that
                        load too slowly.

                    <h4>Play with color</h4>
                    <p>
                        Parallax scrolling isn't just about the images in the foreground and background,
                        but about color, too. You might use more desaturated tones in the background and
                        more lively colors in the foreground to create an even greater sense of depth.
